Master mind is a game where 2 players take turns guessing a number of times an opponents code made with
a number of different pieces where the code maker gives feedback with two different types of pieces about 
which of the guessed code is correct. Those two feedback pieces represent: 1. that a guessed piece is in a
correct spot in the right color, 2. and the correct piece played in the wrong position. If there are more of
one type of guessed piece than there are of that type piece in the code then the extra pieces will not be
awarded feedback.
